Application Features
====================
1. This application navigates to www.Groupon.com, and upon seeing the prompt for email and zipcode, enters values and proceeds next.
2. It goes to All Deals page, scrolls down to the bottom and clicks on "30 More Deals" button to expand all deals multiple times until there are no more to load.
3. It captures the main details - title, merchant, price, location and url of all the deals and prints out to a text file in a neat readable format.
4. It prints the runtime progress of application onto the eclipse console.
5. Currently it uses specific email address and zipcode to get past the initial popup.

Future Enhancements
===================
1. This application can be parameterized if needed, to input customized email, zipcode, browser of choice, file/folder, other output methods.
2. Firefox WebDriver was chosen to demonstrate the UI automation. In order to improve the running time, the Firefox Webdriver can be replaced by a HTML Unit Driver.
